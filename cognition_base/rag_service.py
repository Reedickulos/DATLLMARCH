"""Retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG) service stub.

This stub demonstrates the interface used by the pipeline to obtain
research insights.  In the ASI‑Arch framework the RAG service
indexes thousands of scientific papers and returns relevant passages
to help the agents reason about new architectures.  Here we return a
static response or echo the query back to illustrate the concept.
